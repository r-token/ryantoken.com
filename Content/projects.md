## CatchUp for iOS

**Featured on Brett Terpstra's <a href="https://esn.fm/systematic/218" target="_blank">Systematic</a> Podcast as one of his 'Top 3' (around 46:21)*

My first public-facing iOS app! First released in May of 2018, I completely rewrote it in May of 2020 using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" target="_blank">SwiftUI</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata" target="_blank">Core Data</a>, and several other improvements.

<br />

<style type="text/css">
.small-resizable-image img {
    text-align: center;
    margin: auto;
    width: 21%;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
</style>

<div>
<a class="small-resizable-image" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catchup-keep-in-touch/id1358023550" target="_blank"><img src="../project_images/catchup-home.png" alt="CatchUp - Home" style="margin-right: 10px;"/></a>

</div>

<br />

CatchUp helps you stay in touch with the people who matter most. You can set reminders for the contacts you choose, and get notified when it's time to CatchUp with them again.

CatchUp is free with no ads, but has a tip jar if you want to buy me a coffee â˜•

Read my blog post about modernizing CatchUp <a href="https://ryantoken.com/blog/catching-up" target="_blank">here</a>.

## StreamScan for iOS

StreamScan is the easiest way for cord cutters to keep track of the channels that live TV services offer. It currently keeps track of channels for ten different services, including YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, and Philo.

*I will soon be rebuilding StreamScan with Apple's new UI Framework, SwiftUI.*
