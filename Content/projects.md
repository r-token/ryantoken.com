What I'm currently working on in my spare time.

## The Golden Hurricast

<style type="text/css">
.resizable-image img {
    text-align: center;
    margin: auto;
    width: 100%;
}
</style>

<div>
<a href="https://thegoldenhurricast.com" target="_blank"><img src="../project_images/TGH-web.png" alt="The Golden Hurricast" style="border-radius: 5px; width: 100%;"/></a>
</div>

<p>
<a href="https://thegoldenhurricast.com" target="_blank">The Golden Hurricast</a> is the leading independent podcast and blog covering Golden Hurricane athletics at The University of Tulsa. I built and maintain the website, as well as co-host the podcast and contribute to blog posts.
</p>

<br />

The Golden Hurricast is completely free. I'll soon have a blog post out about the project, the process of building the website/blog, and more.

## StreamScan for iOS

StreamScan is the easiest way for cord cutters to keep track of the channels that live TV services offer. It currently keeps track of channels for ten different services, including YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, and Philo.

<br />

*I am currently rebuilding StreamScan with Apple's new UI Framework, SwiftUI.*

## CatchUp for iOS

**Featured on Brett Terpstra's <a href="https://esn.fm/systematic/218" target="_blank">Systematic</a> Podcast as one of his 'Top 3' (around 46:21)*

<br />

My first public-facing iOS app! I don't work on it much anymore, but am considering rebuilding it with SwiftUI.

<br />

CatchUp helps you stay in touch with the people who matter most. You can set reminders for the contacts you choose, and get notified when it's time to CatchUp with them again.

<br />

CatchUp is free with no ads, but has a tip jar if you want to buy me a coffee â˜•
