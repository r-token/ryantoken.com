## Dashing Through the 'Ville

}
</style>

<p>
<a href="https://dashingthroughtheville.com" target="_blank">Dashing Through the 'Ville</a> is a city-wide scavenger hunt held throughout Bartlesville, Oklahoma.
</p>

Proceeds from the event benefitted Youth and Family Services of Washington County, and it helped them raise a total of $15,000.

The web app is fully serverless – built with <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React</a> on the front end, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a> as the middle tier and back end, and hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. The AWS services used include Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SES, Cognito, Amplify, IAM, and more.

</div>

I was the sole developer for this project. As a volunteer, I ended up building the entire application in a span of three weeks.

We had about three hundred users throughout the city, and heard of no incidents throughout the event.

## CatchUp for iOS

**Featured on Brett Terpstra's <a href="https://esn.fm/systematic/218" target="_blank">Systematic</a> Podcast as one of his 'Top 3' (around 46:21)*

My first public-facing iOS app! First released in May of 2018, I completely rewrote it in May of 2020 using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" target="_blank">SwiftUI</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata" target="_blank">Core Data</a>, and several other improvements.

<br />

<style type="text/css">
.small-resizable-image img {
    text-align: center;
    margin: auto;
    width: 21%;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
</style>

<div>
<a class="small-resizable-image" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catchup-keep-in-touch/id1358023550" target="_blank"><img src="../project_images/catchup-home.png" alt="CatchUp - Home" style="margin-right: 10px;"/></a>

<a class="small-resizable-image" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catchup-keep-in-touch/id1358023550" target="_blank"><img src="../project_images/catchup-details.png" alt="CatchUp - Details" style="margin-right: 10px;"/></a>

<a class="small-resizable-image" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catchup-keep-in-touch/id1358023550" target="_blank"><img src="../project_images/catchup-preference.png" alt="CatchUp - Preference" style="margin-right: 10px;"/></a>

<a class="small-resizable-image" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catchup-keep-in-touch/id1358023550" target="_blank"><img src="../project_images/catchup-tipjar.png" alt="CatchUp - Tip Jar"/></a>
</div>

<br />

CatchUp helps you stay in touch with the people who matter most. You can set reminders for the contacts you choose, and get notified when it's time to CatchUp with them again.

CatchUp is free with no ads, but has a tip jar if you want to buy me a coffee ☕

## Eagle Crest HOA

I'm currently working on a new serverless web application for the Eagle Crest HOA in St. Louis, Missouri. We plan to go live with the app in mid to late-February of 2021.

Similar to Dashing Through the 'Ville, it's built with <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React</a> on the front end, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a> as the middle tier and the back end, and is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.

AWS services used for this include S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SES, Cognito, Amplify, and more.
