</style><h1>Rebuilding My Website</h1><p><em>Why I decided to rebuild ryantoken.com from the ground up, and how I did it with Swift (and without JavaScript)</em></p><br /><h2>Humble Beginnings</h2><p>The summer of 2015 was the summer between my sophomore and junior year at the University of Tulsa. I had taken a few programming classes by that point, and was drawn to web development. To prove to myself that I knew my way around the basics, I wanted to build a website for myself ‚Äì I didn't have a plan for it, I just knew that I wanted it.</p><p>Most recently, I had learned about a tool called <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"><strong>Bootstrap</strong></a>. Everyone and their mother raved about Bootstrap. In 2015, it seemed like the end-all be-all for responsive web design. Spoiler: it isn't. But I, an impressionable soon-to-be junior in college, Bootstrapped the ever-loving heck out of version one of my website.</p><p>See for yourself:</p><br /><div class="resizable-image">
    <img src="../../blog_images/websiteV1.JPG" alt="ryantoken.com v1" style="border-radius: 5px; width:800px;"/>
</div><br /><p>You don't get much more Bootstrapped than that.</p><p>There are several items, just on that home page, that scream Bootstrap (and inexperience) if you know what you're looking for.</p><p>What screams Bootstrap? If you're familiar with it at all, you'll probably notice them immediately. The header, the Jumbotron (or Hero Unit, as Bootstrap now calls it), the three-column layout, and the footer.</p><p>All four of those items are classic, vanilla Bootstrap with very few modifications. Remember ‚Äì in 2015 I was a bona-fide noob in the world of web development. I had no idea what I was doing. Bootstrap was awesome, and in some ways still is. It solved a lot of problems for a fledgling web developer.</p><p>What screams inexperience? Well, basically, everything else. Apparently CSS gradients were the greatest things I'd ever seen, as I threw different variations of them wherever I could fit them.</p><p>But hey, this was the first website I had built completely on my own, with no input from a boss, teachers, or fellow students. I was, and still am, proud that I built it. I learned a lot that I wouldn't have learned otherwise, it helped solidify my love of web development, and when all was said and done, there was a product out there that the world could see.</p><h2>Iterations</h2><p>So that was 2015. Until this complete rebuild in March of 2020, it stayed <em>more or less</em> the same for the next several years. It did go through a couple of design refreshes over that time, though.</p><p>Notably:</p><br /><div class="resizable-image">
    <img src="../../blog_images/websitev2.JPG" alt="ryantoken.com v2" style="border-radius: 5px; width:800px;"/>
</div><br /><p>And then:</p><br /><div class="resizable-image">
    <img src="../../blog_images/websiteV3.png" alt="ryantoken.com v3" style="border-radius: 5px; width:800px;"/>
</div><br /><p>In the first of those two design refreshes, I got my feet wet with transparency, and added some dynamic functionality to the footer that let you navigate the website page-by-page from there.</p><p>The second is how the website looked just a week or so before I published the rebuild you're reading this on now.</p><p>I finally got rid of those blue-teal gradient boxes, added some dimensionality and pictures to the pages, and dramatically simplified the codebase.</p><p>However, after five years, it was time for a dramatic re-think of my website. The current site felt stale and I didn't enjoy working on it or adding to it as much anymore. More than anything, though, was the fact that I'm out of college now and no longer feel I need as much of a 'resume' site.</p><p>The previous site was very much focused on me, my resume, and my portfolio of projects. My mindset has shifted dramatically since then, and so my website needed to shift dramatically with it.</p><h2>A Full Redesign, Built with Swift</h2><p>I knew I wanted to completely recreate the website with modern developer tools and a system that would be easy and fun to iterate on. I did not know, however, what exactly I'd be using to kick this off. My goals for the website were the following:</p><ul><li>First and foremost ‚Äì a blogging component</li><li>A 'Projects' page to show what I've been working on recently</li><li>An 'About' page for, well, anything else</li></ul><br /><p>I've added several new skills to my personal toolbox since 2015. I now tend to use <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> for web projects, plus <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> for iOS projects.</p><p>I run a podcast and blog covering University of Tulsa athletics on the side, and as part of that I built <a href="https://thegoldenhurricast.com">our website</a> with React. This was my first React project, and you might see some similarities to the screenshots above. That's because, more for comfort than anything, I used <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React-Bootstrap</a> to create the front-end. It's basically Bootstrap rebuilt for use in a React environment. It was easy to pick up due to my familiarity with Bootstrap, and I liked it, but I've since been using <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material-UI</a> for React projects.</p><p>On the other hand, I've been pretty deep into iOS development since 2017. I taught myself Swift, released my <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catchup-keep-in-touch/id1358023550">first iOS app</a> in May of 2017, and have several more that I've worked on locally but haven't released. I <em>really</em> enjoy writing code with Swift. The type-safety, readability, community, and more made it incredibly fun and learn.</p><p>I've long wanted to build a website with Swift, but was never fully satisfied with the (limited) number of tools available to me. I had also toyed around with server-side Swift frameworks like <a href="https://vapor.codes/">Vapor</a> and <a href="https://www.kitura.io/">Kitura</a>, but found both to be capable but overly-complicated solutions for what I needed.</p><p>And then I found <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>. Publish is "a static site generator for Swift developers" built by <a href="https://twitter.com/johnsundell">John Sundell</a> ‚Äì a former lead iOS developer for Spotify who now runs his own company called <a href="https://swiftbysundell.com">Swift by Sundell</a> that is, obviously, all about Swift development. All of Swift by Sundell is built using Publish.</p><p>Publish was exactly what I was looking for. It lets you build and configure your complete website with Swift and Markdown, nearly everything is customizable, and it comes with native support for blogging. It also supports custom themes, plugins, and a host of other powerful options.</p><p>The main Swift file to build a site with Publish is incredibly simple to understand. Here's what mine first looked like:</p><br /><div class="resizable-image">
    <img src="../../blog_images/publish-basic.png" alt="main.Swift file in Publish" style="border-radius: 5px; width:800px;"/>
</div><br /><p>First, there's an enum called SectionID. This is where you describe what sections your website will have. Mine are the four main tabs at the top of the page: <a href="https://ryantoken.com/blog">Blog</a>, <a href="https://ryantoken.com/projects">Projects</a>, <a href="https://ryantoken.com/meta">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://ryantoken.com/about">About</a>.</p><p>Next, there's a struct called ItemMetadata. This is site-specific metadata which we‚Äôll be able to use in a fully type-safe manner all throughout our publishing process. I don't have anything in there at this point because, honestly, I don't know what benefit it would give a site as simple as mine.</p><p>And finally, there are five variables set that finalize some information for the website. The last step is the 'try' statement that actually calls on Publish to generate the HTML and CSS files that your browser will serve up to show you this page.</p><p>It's really an amazing process.</p><p>This blog post, and every one that will come after it, are simple <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> files that the Swift package can reference.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>When this post comes out, I will still be using Publish's built-in theme for the site. However, Publish uses another framework (also built by John Sundell) called Plot that allows for custom themes to be built and used by Publish.</p><p>My next goal for this site is to create my own theme and really customize a lot of it. Step one was just to get it the new site out the door.</p><p>I'm incredibly excited for the journey that this site will lead me down. I've been dying to use Swift for something outside of strictly Ô£ø development, and have also badly wanted to create my own blog. Publish satisfies both of those needs while allowing for as little or as much customization as I'd want or need.</p><p>I plan to dive head-first into Plot (his theming engine) in the very near future to add some more color, dynamism, and customization to the site. Keep an eye out for changes in that area soon.</p><p>In the meantime, I'll probably be writing about my experience with React while buildling [thegoldenhurricast.com] in the next month or so. After that, I will absolutely have a post or two once 2020 WWDC kicks off in an <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/03/apples-wwdc-2020-kicks-off-in-june-with-an-all-new-online-format/">online-only</a> format in June.</p><p>Stay tuned! I can't wait to see how this goes.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
